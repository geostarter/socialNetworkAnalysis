# socialNetworkAnalysis (In Progress)

Authors: Nicholas Stoterau, Coleman Shepard


Working with Josef Woldense, an Assistant Professor in the department of African American & African Studies and Affiliated Faculty in Political Science at the University of Minnesota, we are using Twitter to try to identify shifts in political identity based on shifts from an influencer using Twitter and Python. This project is ongoing and will continually be updated.
